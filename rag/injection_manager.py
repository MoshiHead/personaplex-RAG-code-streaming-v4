"""
Generic, mode-agnostic token-injection primitive for PersonaPlex's continuous streaming decoder.

Read docs/STREAMING_AND_INJECTION_DESIGN.md (Sections 3-4) for the full reasoning. Summary of the
constraints this module is built around:

  - PersonaPlex has no "prompt string". All conditioning -- the persona/system prompt, the voice
    prompt, and (with this module) RAG context -- enters the live model through
    `LMGen.step(...)`, one ~80ms frame at a time. There is no batched-prefill code path.
  - The real attention KV-cache (`RingKVCache`, in moshi/moshi/modules/transformer.py) is an
    append-only ring buffer, shared across an entire connection, and mutated by exactly one
    coroutine in the reference server: the one running `opus_loop`. It has NO internal locking.
  - Therefore: this module's stepping methods must only ever be invoked from that same single
    coroutine/thread for a given LMGen instance. Calling it concurrently from a second task WILL
    corrupt the shared streaming state. This module does not add a lock itself, because a lock
    would (incorrectly) imply concurrent use is safe if you just wait your turn -- it is not; the
    fix is "only ever call this from the opus_loop-equivalent coroutine," which is a call-site
    discipline, not something a lock here can enforce.
  - Injecting must NEVER call `reset_streaming()` -- that wipes the entire live conversation's
    RingKVCache (persona prompt, voice prompt, and all prior turns), not just "the prompt".
  - CRITICAL (found via a real Mode D run -- see docs/MODE_D_REDESIGN.md): forcing
    `text_token=X` via `step()` does not mean "show the model X as context it can choose to react
    to later." It means "the model's output at this position IS X, right now" -- the audio
    depformer also conditions on whichever text token is active each frame, forced or not. This
    is harmless ONLY when nothing reads/forwards `step()`'s resolved output while forcing happens
    (true for the persona prompt and for `run_to_completion`/`run_to_completion_async` when called
    *before* a real generation loop starts watching output, as Modes B/C do). It actively corrupts
    both the visible transcript and the spoken audio if forced steps are interleaved with a real
    generation loop that IS reading output at the same time -- do not build an "incremental,
    one-forced-step-per-real-tick" injection mode; always inject as one self-contained burst
    (`run_to_completion`/`run_to_completion_async`), even if triggered mid-conversation (Mode D).

This module intentionally has zero dependency on `moshi`, `torch`, or any vector-store/embedding
library, so it is fully unit-testable with plain Python stand-ins (see
rag/tests/test_injection_manager.py) without a GPU or the real model loaded. It is the one
primitive that Modes C, D, E and F (Phase 1 architecture report, Section 6) all reuse; the
decision of *when* to call it and *what text* to inject is the caller's policy, not this module's
concern.
