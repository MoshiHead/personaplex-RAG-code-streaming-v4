"""
Glue layer between the moshi-agnostic rag/ primitives (TokenInjector, Retriever, RequestLogger)
and a live PersonaPlex connection (moshi.server.ServerState.handle_chat) or a single offline run
(moshi.offline.run_inference).

This is the *only* rag/ module that is written with moshi's concrete runtime objects in mind
(a real `LMGen`, a real SentencePiece tokenizer, the zero/sine frame factories) -- every other
module in this package (config, retriever, embeddings, vector_store, injection_manager,
turn_detector) stays moshi-agnostic and importable/testable without moshi installed. This module
has no import-time dependency on moshi either (it only needs *objects* satisfying the protocols
`TokenInjector` already defines), so it remains independently unit-testable with plain stand-ins
-- see rag/tests/test_server_integration.py.

        already explains. Returns `(record, retrieval_dict)` otherwise, where `retrieval_dict` is
        `Retriever.retrieve_context`'s `{"query", "contexts", "scores"}` -- note that
        `retrieval_dict["contexts"]` may be EMPTY (nothing scored above `score_threshold`, or the
        knowledge base itself has no documents): callers must check for that and, when
        `config.strict_scope` is set, inject an explicit decline instruction
        (`build_out_of_scope_notice`) instead of treating an empty result the same as "stop
        immediately." This is what makes the assistant decline an out-of-scope question instead
        of silently falling back to its own pretrained knowledge (see docs/PRODUCTION_RAG.md).

        Both Mode B and Mode C retrieve identically -- the *only* thing that should differ between
        them is how the retrieved text gets formatted before injection. Sharing this step is what
        guarantees that property rather than relying on two copy-pasted implementations staying in

        `query` may be falsy (`None`/`""`). This is the normal case for a real live connection

        a `rag_query` parameter (it didn't exist when the UI was built) -- so a live connection
        simply never has a query string to retrieve against. Skipping injection entirely in that
        case would mean RAG never engages for any real conversation, only for callers that
        explicitly pass a query (`moshi.offline --rag-query`, or `rag.ws_demo_client`'s scripted
        demo). Instead, falsy `query` falls back to
        `Retriever.retrieve_all(limit=config.full_kb_max_chunks)` -- injecting the **whole**
        knowledge base by default (`full_kb_max_chunks` defaults to `None`, meaning uncapped), in
        insertion order, since there is no query to rank against. This is deliberately NOT capped
        at `top_k` -- `top_k` bounds a *ranked* similarity-search result, where cutting the
        lowest-ranked tail is reasonable; the no-query path has no ranking at all, so capping it
        at the same small default silently and deterministically drops whichever chunks happen to
        come later in the source document (a real bug this caused -- see
        docs/PRODUCTION_RAG.md Section 9). See that doc for this fallback's remaining limits (it

        phases are the only thing this method can time -- whatever happens next (the live
        server's open-ended duplex conversation, or `offline.py`'s bounded generation loop) is the
        caller's to measure. Call `finalize_and_log(record, ...)` exactly once, when the caller
