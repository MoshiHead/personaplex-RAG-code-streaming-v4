"""
Unit tests for rag.build_index's plain-text ingestion path (chunk_text /
load_documents_from_text_file / build_index_from_text_file) -- the "Production RAG Streaming
Mode" entry point (see docs/PRODUCTION_RAG.md). `chunk_text`/`load_documents_from_text_file` are
pure-Python and always run; `build_index_from_text_file`'s end-to-end test monkeypatches the
embedder the same way rag/tests/test_retriever.py does, so it needs real `faiss` but not a real
